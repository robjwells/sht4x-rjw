/// ```rust
/// # use embedded_hal_mock::eh1::i2c::{Mock, Transaction};
/// # fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
/// #   let mut delay = embedded_hal_mock::eh1::delay::NoopDelay::new();
/// #   let expectations = [
/// #     // Request the sensor serial number.
/// #     Transaction::write(0x44, vec![0x89]),
/// #     // Receive a fake sensor serial number.
/// #     Transaction::read(0x44, vec![0x01, 0x02, 0x17, 0x3, 0x4, 0x68]),

/// #     Transaction::write(0x44, vec![0xFD]),
